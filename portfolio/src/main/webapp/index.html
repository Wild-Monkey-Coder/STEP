                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mathew Suarez. I am currently a
                    Google STEP intern, and as part of my work training I have 
                    put together this portfolio to indtroduce myself, my interests,
                    and a few of the projects I've done before and during STEP. I was
                    part of the Google CSSI (Computer Science Summer Institute) and
                    it motivated me to do STEP this year. Feel free to take a look at
                    my Github or add me on LinkedIn, which are both linked below.</p>

            <div class="left-side-text-container text-container">
                <p>I was born in the US and was raised here in Georgia until I was 11 
                    yeras old. My parents are from Colombia, but in 2011 they moved back
                    and I went with them. I lived there for 6 years in the city of Bogota
                    before moving back to the US with my great aunt so I could finish high 
                    school, find better opportunities to succeed professionally, and 
                    attend a better university than I would have been able to afford in 
                    Colombia.<br>
                    From a young age I was interested in technology and knew I wanted to 
                    learn to create amazing products. At that time, I thought I would grow
                    up to become an engineer. It wasn't until high school that I learned 
                    about computer science and programming, and soon I knew that I wanted 
                    to have a career in software. This interest in the field that pushed me
                    to be part of CSSI in 2019, and return to Google as a STEP intern in 2020.
                    Currently, I am a Computer Science student at the University of 
                    Gerogia with a minor in Cognitive Science.<br> 
                    In my free time, I enjoy watching super hero movies and playing vdeo games.
                    I especially enjoy stategy games or base building games where I get to
                    find creative solutions to problems and can help me keep my critical 
                    thinking skills sharp even when I'm winding down. However, entertainment
                    has also been a source of inspiration for me. Science fiction and
                    fantasy allow us to imagine what the world could be like, and often 
                    inspire me to contemplate how possible some fictional technolgies.
