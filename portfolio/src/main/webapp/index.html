                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mathew Suarez. I am currently a
                        Google STEP intern, and as part of my work training I have 
                        put together this portfolio to indtroduce myself, my interests,
                        and a few of the projects I've done before and during STEP. I was
                        part of the Google CSSI (Computer Science Summer Institute) and
                        it motivated me to do STEP this year. Feel free to take a look at
                        my Github or add me on LinkedIn, which are both linked below. </p>
