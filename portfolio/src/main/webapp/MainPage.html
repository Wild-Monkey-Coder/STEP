                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mathew Suarez. I am currently a
                    Google STEP intern, and as part of my work training I have 
                    put together this portfolio to indtroduce myself, my interests,
                    and a few of the projects I've done before and during STEP. I was
                    part of the Google CSSI (Computer Science Summer Institute) and
                    it motivated me to do STEP this year. Feel free to take a look at
                    my Github or add me on LinkedIn, which are both linked below.</p>

            <div class="left-side-text-container text-container">
                <p>I was born in the US and was raised here in Georgia until I was 11 
                    years old. My parents are from Colombia, but in 2011 they moved back
                    and I went with them. I lived there for 6 years in the city of Bogota
                    before moving back to the US with my great aunt so I could finish high 
                    school, find better opportunities to succeed professionally, and 
                    attend a better university than I would have been able to afford in 
                    Colombia.<br>
                    From a young age I was interested in technology and knew I wanted to 
                    learn to create amazing products. At that time, I thought I would grow
                    up to become an engineer. It wasn't until high school that I learned 
                    about computer science and programming, and soon I knew that I wanted 
                    to have a career in software. This interest in the field that pushed me
                    to be part of CSSI in 2019, and return to Google as a STEP intern in 2020.
                    Currently, I am a Computer Science student at the University of 
                    Gerogia with a minor in Cognitive Science.<br> 
                    In my free time, I enjoy watching super hero movies and playing vdeo games.
                    I especially enjoy stategy games or base building games where I get to
                    find creative solutions to problems and can help me keep my critical 
                    thinking skills sharp even when I'm winding down. However, entertainment
                    has also been a source of inspiration for me. Science fiction and
                    fantasy allow us to imagine what the world could be like, and often 
                    inspire me to contemplate how possible some fictional technologies.</p>

                    <p>I have been playing league of legends since 2015 when
                        my best friend introduced me to the game. I didn't play
                        often because back then my computer was so bad we called
                        it a toaster. When I moved back to the US, I started
                        working part time and bought a new computer which could
                        run the game. I still play the game at least once a week
                        because it's how I stay in touch with my best friend who 
                        is still in Colombia. Personally, I enjoy the game because 
                        of the high skill ceiling many of the champions have which 
                        offer interesting goals to work towards. However, I sometimes
                        don't enjoy playing because of how the game evolves over 
                        time, requiring that I invest more time (which I don't have 
                        much of these days) to adapt to the changing meta.</p>

                    <p>Besides MOBA games like League of legends, I also really enojy
                        base-building and strategy games like Oxygen Not Included. What's
                        great about this game is that it pushes me to try and build a
                        colony while trying to overcome multiple issues that can come up,
                        included the one presented in the title: a lack of oxygen for colonists.
                        I've played this game and lost track of time trying to design
                        efficient base set ups and trying to conqueor the asteroid, and the
                        underlying mechanics which govern the game such as power production,
                        heat, disease, automation, etc., make it an amazing game I love to play.</p>

                    <p>I have always wanted to work on creating new technologies
                        which would change the world for the better. Something that
                        excites is the idea of space colonization and human expansion.
                        In recent years, governments and people have begun thinking
                        about colonizing Mars, which is a remarkable endeavor. Though
                        I am interested because of my love of making science fiction a 
                        reality, the idea of colonizing Mars is also motivated by the
                        fact that in a few years we may finish destroying the Earth,
                        and to give our species and descendents hope, humanity needs a
                        backup planet. I am frightened that my grandchildren will 
                        inherit an inhospitable planet, so the thought that I could
                        contribute to giving them a fresh start on another world consoles me.

                    <p>I am a Computer Science major, but what this means for me is that I
                        am learning and acquiring the tools to work in almost any field I
                        choose. For a long time I didn't know what I was really interested in,
                        but a few years ago I realized that what really interested me was
                        artificial intelligence. What I truly want to do in the future is
                        conduct research on human-computer interaction and digital assitants,
                        and make AI more accesible to individuals. When I envision the future,
                        I want to help build a future where software doesn't replace people,
                        but instead empowers them to do greater things they couldn't have before.</p>
